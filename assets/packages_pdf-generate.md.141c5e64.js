This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.</p><p>Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except <code>eject</code> will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.</p><p>You don’t have to ever use <code>eject</code>. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature.
