Remember! You can download and add the H5P file in the *h5p format.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/EscolaLMS/H5P/assets/108077902/e0648dd3-533d-4a4e-8893-efbac9c4453b" alt="image"></p><p>This is how the file will look after downloading it to your computer.

For example, if we added a multiple-choice test and named it &quot;Exam on Country Flags&quot;, searching for the phrase &quot;Exam&quot; or &quot;country flags&quot; in this field will display that specific item on the list.</p><p><strong>Library ID</strong> - allows you to search for specific types of exercises (e.g., Drag and Drop) by their assigned IDs in the system. Below are the IDs that will facilitate the search for the desired H5P elements in:</p><ul><li>Accordion - ID: 1</li><li>Agamotto - ID: 2</li><li>Arithmetic Quiz - ID: 4</li><li>Audio Recorder - ID: 5</li><li>Collage - ID: 6</li></ul><p>As usual, to apply the filters we have set, press the blue &quot;Query&quot; button.

This is a safeguard to prevent accidental deletion. You need to remove the exercise from the course first before you can delete it from the library.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/EscolaLMS/H5P/assets/108077902/9f9dc88d-49a9-4448-a230-e8f9cc10b9fe" alt="image"></p><p>When creating a new exercise on the platform, we use the H5P template editor. By clicking &quot;+New,&quot; the exercise selection editor opens, where we choose the desired template to fill in. Finally, we click the &quot;submit data&quot; button to save our exercise and add it to the library.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/EscolaLMS/H5P/assets/108077902/d9ba019e-ca25-4ad8-bc11-764fea2935a3" alt="image"></p><p>As a reminder, we can add or create H5P directly within the course being created. We use the H5P Topic to import an exercise or create one from a template.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/EscolaLMS/H5P/assets/108077902/797984ed-0285-4761-8bfb-c92fb3fab538" alt="image"></p><p>Certainly, you can also add an H5P file to the topic being created using interactive exercises.
