**Part (1) is the platform navigation bar**, allowing you to change tabs at any time to access different categories or functionalities:

* Welcome = Dashboard
* Courses
* Sales
* User
* Analytics
* Configuration
* Other activities

**Part (2) at the top displays the notifications icon**, a small activity log with red indicators and numerical counts of new activities on the panel. Next to it is a statement that we are logged into our account (displaying our username), with the option to change the platform's language at the end. The button below takes us to the platform's Front.

**Part (3) contains the main window**, displaying all the operations being performed, such as adding new courses and configuring existing courses.

In the main window, by scrolling down, we can see the information of administrative reports. Reports can be configured according to our needs, and on the Dashboard, we can have the most interesting reports from the platform.
