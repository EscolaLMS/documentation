# Admin panel documentation

The Course Access package is designed to handle access management for courses.
It provides a set of functions that are used both in the Admin Panel and on the Front App.

## Course Access

In the course details, there is an "Access" tab.
In this section, you can both grant and revoke access to the course to individual users, as well as groups of users.

## Access Requests

To manage access requests submitted by users for the course, there is a separate tab called "Access Requests."
Within it, you will find user information, course details, and extra data.

Clicking the "Approve" button grants access to the user for the course.
You can also remove the request.
