In future Backend API component will gather anonymise user collected backend data.

This will include

- what backend components are installed and what version are in used
- system information from [`$\_SERVER](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php) environment - all data like IP addresses will be trimmed before sent

**This is not yet an implemented feature!**
