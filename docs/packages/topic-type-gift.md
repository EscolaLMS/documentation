## What does it do

This package is another [TopicType](https://github.com/EscolaLMS/topic-types). It is used to make knowledge tests.
If you want to learn more about this format then see [Moodle GIFT format](https://docs.moodle.org/402/en/GIFT_format)

This package supports the following types of questions:
- multiple choice 
- multiple choice with multiple right answers
- true-false
- short answers
- matching
- numerical question 
- essay 
- description

Each question is stored in the database as a string. In the tests you can see examples of questions of different types. See [examples](https://github.com/EscolaLMS/Topic-Type-GIFT/blob/main/tests/GiftQuestionTesting.php)

The quiz can have a set maximum number of attempts for the user to solve the test and a maximum time for each attempt.
If the user doesn't complete the attempt then it is closed automatically after the time set by the variable `Config::get('escolalms_gift_quiz.max_quiz_time');`
The user will see the results when the attempt is finished.

The answer to an essay type question is not automatically graded. The teacher should do it.
