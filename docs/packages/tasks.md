## What does it do
This package is used to manage user tasks. Users can create their own tasks or assign tasks to other system users.

Tasks can be marked as ready/not ready only by users who created the task.
If the task is assigned to another user, a request is sent to checking the correctness of the task.
The user sending the request then receives a notification of the task verification status.

Notes can be added to an assignment. Notes can be added by the task author or assigned user. Each note contains information about who created the note.

The packet also has a scheduled task that reminds you of overdue tasks.
By default, the reminder period is set to 30 days.
No notifications will be sent for tasks older than 30 days.
