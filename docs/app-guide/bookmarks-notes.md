## Bookmarks-Notes

The discussed feature is located on the front page of the platform. It is primarily used by platform users to make notes and bookmarks within a course. Starting from the beginning, the user logs in to the front page of the platform.

Inside the course, the user will have a visible toolbar at the bottom of the screen, which includes a notepad and an option to add bookmarks.

The user can write an individual note in each of the topics. Notes are visible only to the person creating them. When returning to the topic at a later time, the note will still be accessible.

By clicking the "Update" button, you can overwrite the existing note with additional content. Alternatively, you can delete the note's content and save an empty notepad.

After adding a bookmark, you will receive a success message at the top of the screen.
