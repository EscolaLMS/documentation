The list of live events is presented as follows:

Sorting of live events is done by ID, Name, Start Date, and End Date. Additionally, you can edit existing events and delete them.

You can see familiar fields like Name, Trainer, Status, Start Date, and End Date. In addition to these, there are:

* Location: An essential field, especially for a live event - the location must be specified.
* Max number of participants: To limit the number of available slots for the event, you can specify the maximum allowable number of participants.
* Short description: A brief description of the event, its purpose.
* Agenda: Specifying the event's agenda, topics.
* Description: Additional information about the event, details.
* Remember to use attractive TEXT FORMATTING.

After confirming such an event, you will receive additional tabs for editing: Product, Media, Categories, and User Registration Without an Account. Their operation has been mentioned multiple times before.

The "Agenda" allows you to present the event, including the schedule of specific speakers' presentations, and the topics they will be discussing.

When adding an agenda, you need to fill in the title and subtitle, the time, and the presenter for the specified time. Optionally, you can add a description of the specific presentation.

Agendas displayed in green require approval as a newly added item. The same applies when editing. After editing the agenda, changes must be approved to prevent users from accidentally seeing newly entered data for events they have already purchased.

The remaining functions are the same as in the previous modules.
* Product - Allows you to set the ticket purchase price for the event. Additionally, if a limit of people for the event has been set, there will be information on the front end, for example, "20 places left."
* Media - Setting the cover image displayed on the front end of the platform for the stationary event.
* Categories - Setting categories for positioning and searching.
* Users Attached without Account - Providing access to the event for a person who does not have an account on the platform. This grants free access to the event, so such a user is not included in the user purchase limit.
